  description: At present, I am working as a postdoctoral researcher at Graduate School Agriculture, Kyoto University. I have developed a space-time finite element for soil dynamics and earthquake engineering problem, wherein the numerical dissipation of high-frequency components can be controlled by the user. I have also developed a space-time finite element method with moving mesh technique to study the transient unconfined seepage flow in dams, levees, and other earthen structures. I am also leading a research team to develop the generalized framework of space-time FEM for dynamic soil-structure interaction problems. This research involves high-performance-computing by using OpenMP, MPI and GPU. I am also investigating the failure of levee and embankments due to overflow by using physical and numerical modeling. For this research, I am developing a software for solving the coupled Navier-Stokes and Darcy-Brinkmann Equations.

  description: I worked as Institute Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Civil Engineering, IIT Bombay, India. During this time, my research was focused on thermo-hydro-mechanical behavior of frozen and unfrozen soils. I investigated on the influence of volumetric ice-content on the shear stregth characteristics of frozen soils. I have also developed an experimental procedure to establish freezing characteristics of partially saturated soils. In addition, I developed a numerical method and computer program to estimate the thermal properties of frozen and unfrozen soils by interpretating Dual-probe heat-pulse data.
