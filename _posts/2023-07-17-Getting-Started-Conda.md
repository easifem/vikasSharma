Conda is a package manager and environment manager.

conda --version
```

## Installing conda

Please follow the instruction given [here](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html).

## Updating conda

```bash

## Creating environment

```bash
conda create -n easifem 
```

or

```bash
conda create --name easifem 
```

> Here, `easifem` is the name of virtual environment.

Then we can activate the environment by

```bash
conda activate easifem
```

To get list of all environment:
