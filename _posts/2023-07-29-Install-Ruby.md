In this post I will demonstrate how to install ruby 3.1.3 on MacOS. I am currently using M2 chip.

```bash
neofetch

I use Jekyll to manage this website. Recently, I have shifted to M2 chip. When I tried to install `ruby:3.1.3` by using chruby and ruby-install package (as recommended by [Jekyll website](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/macos/)), I faced some difficulties which lead to ultimate failed installation.

So, I followed different approach, which works very smoothly and quickly.

I use [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) to manage ruby version on MacOS, which is located here.

#### Installing rbenv

```bash
brew install rbenv ruby-build
```

Then please run the following command, and follow the instruction.

```bash
# run this and follow the printed instructions:
rbenv init
```

I use `fish` shell, which gives me following instruction.

```bash
# Load rbenv automatically by appending
# the following to ~/.config/fish/config.fish:

status --is-interactive; and rbenv init - fish | source
```

#### Installing Ruby version

The `rbenv` install command does not ship with rbenv out-of-the-box, but is provided by the ruby-build plugin.

Before attempting to install Ruby, check that your build environment has the necessary tools and libraries. Then:

```bash
# list latest stable versions:
rbenv install -l

# list all local versions:
rbenv install -L

# install a Ruby version:
rbenv install 3.1.3
```

Set a Ruby version to finish installation and start using Ruby:

```bash
rbenv global 3.1.3   # set the default Ruby version for this machine
rbenv local 3.1.3   # set the Ruby version for this directory
```

I do not want to set Ruby globally, therefore, I use the second command.

Now go to the directory which contains your Ruby project. Then activate ruby to 3.1.3 by using

```bash
rbenv local 3.1.3
```

Then, we install jekyll.

```bash
gem install jekyll bundler
```

Then, build the site and make it available on a local server.

```bash
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
