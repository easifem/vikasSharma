# Input and output in Lua

In this post I will describe my understanding of input and output operations in Lua. In any programming language we have two types of input or output devices (sometimes they are also called buffer); standard devices and user given devices.

- Standard output (stdout) and input  (stdin) buffers are usually terminal window and keyboard.
- User defined IO-buffers can be external files or internal file: the former is located on the hard-disk of the computer, and the latter remains in the memory of the running computer program.
